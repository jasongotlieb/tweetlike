Your momma used to live at the church on Sunday
You just go to LIV after church on Sunday
Oh Lord, oh Lord we're not in Kansas anymore
We're not in Kansas anymore
[Verse 1]
When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)
We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)
When my dad drove me to Memphis one time from Toronto, it was a 20-something hour drive. I brought my Doggystyle cassette. I asked him, "Dad, can I please play this? Mom won't let me play it in the house." He was like, "Yeah. You can play it for 20 minutes. And then we listen to an hour of my music."
 That was Al Green, that was the Spinners, that was Sade. That was Marvin Gaye. At the time, I was like, "Aw, man, come on, 20 minutes?" But it really was pivotal for me because I started listening to the melodies and the emotion in this music that he was playing me. It grabbed me maybe even a little more than that Doggystyle cassette did. I would say that I'm more moved by melody, even though I love to rap.
That's all I wanted to do, at first. I loved music. I just didn't necessarily believe in music being the focus right away. But I used to watch, at the time, young kids that were poppin'—it was B2K and Bow Wow. It was that generation of the R&B group, and the sort of every song is a "girl" song—it was all targeted towards screaming girls—the Scream Tour. You remember?
No. This is after. This is like, when I'm old enough to say, "I want to be these guys" or "I want to be in that position." This is like a very young Chris Brown, a very young Lil Wayne. That was Scream Tour—any act that made the girls scream. There was definitely a point where I would watch that and be like, "Yo." I would watch these young kids and I would say, "Damn. I want to be there. I just want to do it different." Because it's like I didn't want my career to be based off of some of the things that they were known for, like having my shirt off.
Yeah, 15, 16, I mean, 17, 18, is when I was really getting into that hip hop phase, you know, and really studying the things that I needed to study as far as learning about flows and learning about lyrics.
I was in class, and I used to always crack jokes in class. I was a good liar and a good talker. And this kid in my class was like, "Yo, my dad is an agent. You should go talk to him because you're good and you make people laugh." I was just good. I was my father's son. I was slick, you know? When it comes to knowing what to say, to charm, I always had it.
I'm obsessed with perfection. I want to work. I don't want to take this for granted. I don't want to sit out here and say, well, I could stop right here and say, "Okay. I own this. You know, it's cool. I could stop," but why? I don't want to stop. I want to take advantage and make myself the best possible me that I can be. So I'm going to work in the gym two hours a day. And try and be up there on stage, looking strong, looking iconic.
I don't mean perfection as far as a visual image of perfection. I mean, "perfection" to me is, I walk away from a situation and say, "I did everything I could do right there. There was nothing more that I could do." I was a hundred percent, like the meter was at the top. There was nothing else I could have done. You know? Like, I worked as hard as I possibly could have. That's perfection.
That's the conflict you're hearing. I'm describing to you what you're hearing in my music. It's got nothing to do with fame or the position that I'm in. I'm happy there is just one aspect of my life that I miss, which is how big those situations used to feel. And not that it felt good. Sometimes it was big pain. Sometimes it was big hurt. Whereas now I'm very—throughout my life, not just with women—I try and remain a very controlled individual.
hat's exactly what it is. Artistically. Inspiration-wise. Knowing you don't have any other option—you got one place to go. To your mom's house. That's it. Go drive home. I miss that, artistically.
New stories, I guess. I just have to find a way to describe it so vividly that it's relatable, because if I don't, if it's not vivid enough, then no one will be able to relate to me. You sitting here in this atmosphere, you can relate to what I'm saying. But if I tried to tell you about this, I don't know if you'd feel it the same way. You understand what I'm saying?
I don't want to go brag about this shit. "Oh, I just got the new crib with the pool." 'Cause it just sounds stupid to you. But then you come here, and you're like, "Oh, shit. Okay, I get it. You're a kid from Toronto and you live here now. This is fucked up."
